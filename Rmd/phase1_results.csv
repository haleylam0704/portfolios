The studies use observational survey data collected from individuals in different cultural and social contexts (Sri Lanka, Morocco, Indonesia). The analyses include moderated mediation models testing pathways between quest for individual and collective significance, ideological extremism, and violent extremism, with social context as a moderator. The use of moderated mediation and interaction terms to infer conditional causal pathways, along with comparisons across groups defined by radical vs. nonradical social contexts, aligns with causal inference methods. However, the studies do not involve experimental manipulation but rely on natural variation and statistical modeling to infer causal relationships, consistent with the 'Causal Inference' category.

The study does not involve experimental manipulation or causal inference methods like diff-in-diffs or IV, but rather combines and describes existing longitudinal correlational data. The focus on synthesizing prior empirical findings and testing moderators aligns with the 'Review/Meta-analysis' category, while the use of longitudinal correlational data without specific causal inference methods also fits 'Descriptive/Correlational' as a secondary category. The data are individual-level self-report measures of self-esteem.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0

It does not involve manipulation of variables or causal inference methods but focuses on describing the structure of perceiver effects (global positivity and trait-specificity) and quantifying their relative contributions. The study also involves methodological aspects such as item selection, model fitting, and handling of improper solutions, aiming to improve measurement and modeling of perceiver effects. Thus, the primary category is Descriptive/Correlational due to the examination of relationships and factor structures without causal inference, and the secondary category is Methodological because of the focus on measurement and modeling methods.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0

The other two studies are correlational but include moderation and mediation analyses. Data are collected at the individual level via self-report questionnaires. Thus, the primary category is Experimental due to the manipulation of autonomy in Study 2, with a secondary category of Descriptive/Correlational reflecting the observational nature of Studies 1a and 1b.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0

The study primarily describes and compares odds ratios without manipulating variables, fitting the Descriptive/Correlational category.

Although no experimental manipulation or random assignment is involved, the use of multiple crime data sources and multiverse analyses to assess robustness aligns partially with Causal Inference approaches.
